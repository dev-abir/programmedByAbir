# programmedByAbir
This repo contains most of the programming projects which I have done till now. These projects are incomplete, very buggy, immature, ugly, not of industry standard. Most of these projects I did when I was learning to code, but most importantly I had a lot of fun doing these. :-)

I haven't uploaded one android project due to it's large size.

I have deleted many projects from this repo on which are not worthy of being hosted in a repo.

I don't want to continue development on these projects.
